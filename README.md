# SLAM Tutorial in Gen

First steps towards a [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) tutorial in Gen. [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/)  is a general-purpose probabilistic programming system, embedded in Julia. I use environments from the [HouseExpo](https://github.com/TeaganLi/HouseExpo) dataset, wich can be found on github. The data set is accompanied by the arXiv preprint:

> Li et al., "HouseExpo: A Large-scale 2D Indoor Layout Dataset for 
> Learning-based Algorithms on Mobile Robots", arXiv (2019).


**Overview.**

Note: This is an incomplete first draft and everything is under heavy construction.
The notebooks don't always render right on Github; the links point to the notebooks in Jupyter's "nbviewer":
